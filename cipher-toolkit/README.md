# Cipher Toolkit

This tool is designed to help in CTFs. The idea is from cipherchef, instead of using the web browser we are going to be using the terminal

## Supported

The supported types of decoder are the following:

- Base 64
- Base 32
- Binary

## Future Work

For future work, i will add morse code, caesar cipher, ROT, hex, a way to bruteforce the algorithm.
